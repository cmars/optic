### What is Proxy Mode?
Optic uses a local proxy to capture API traffic, and learn from it. Running your API with Optic's proxy in front of it is easy. You just have to replace your normal start command with Optic's:


When you run `api start` Optic's CLI will  manage the lifecycle of your API, starting it on a port that Optic provides with the`PORT` environment variable. Optic then starts a proxy on the port your project usually starts on, and forwards the traffic to your application.

To your consuming applications / tools, the API appears to be running on the port where it usually starts, the only difference is that Optic will be able to observe all the traffic to help and test your API.
