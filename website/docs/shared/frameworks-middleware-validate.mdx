title: Setup - Integrate Optic via Middleware
---

import ExpandDocs from '../../src/components/Expand';

We recommend collecting some traffic with the Middleware to validate it is set up correctly. Start up your project with Optic, using the `--verbose` flag:

```
api run start --verbose
```

Next, run some traffic through your application. We recommend running at least 5 requests against multiple endpoints to get different behavior coverage. This will help validate the traffic is observed correctly:

```
[optic-verbose] Starting a local server that receives traffic sent from your SDK/Middleware to http://localhost:3700/
[optic-verbose] Running command node basic-http-server.js
Running command: node basic-http-server.js
Traffic can be sent to: http://localhost:3700/
```

<ExpandDocs title="Potential issue: the project start command is not working" defaultOpen={false}>

```
/bin/sh: noder: command not found
[optic-verbose] Task finished with 0 samples in latest capture
```

This error occurs when the start task cannot run. The output of the command, and any failure items, will show up here. In this example the command `noder` is not found. The running command was `noder server.js --port $PORT` instead of `node ...`. This looks like a simple typo, a quick fix.

```
Listen http://localhost:3000
... traffic captures show up here
^C[optic-verbose] Task finished with 5 samples in latest capture
```

Success! Repeat the same steps for your `test` command:

```
api run test --verbose
```
