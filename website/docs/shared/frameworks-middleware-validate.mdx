title: Setup - Integrate Optic via Middleware
slug: /reference/frameworks-middleware-validate
---

We recommend collecting some traffic with the Middleware to validate it is set up correctly. Start up your project with Optic, using the `--verbose` flag

```
api run start --verbose
```

```
start an exec session, look at the output
```

Send some requests using Curl, Postman or another tool. You should see samples getting saved for Optic to learn from:

```
Sample 1....
```

Repeat the same steps for your `test` command:

```
api run test --verbose
```
