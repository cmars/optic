### What is the Optic SDK

The most effective way to integrate your project with Optic is to use an Optic SDK. The SDK provides a middleware for your project to capture all traffic, no matter how or where it is generated. Regardless of how your tests run today, or how you instrument your project locally and in CI, Optic will be able to help you doucment your API and alert you to differences in behavior.

<h3>Setting up your Optic SDK with {props.title}</h3>

<>The latest instructions for the <a href={props.sdk_url}>{props.title} SDK</a> are kept alongside the SDK itself in a <a href={props.sdk_readme}>README.md</a>. Once you've integrated the SDK, we'll validate that it is working properly.</>
