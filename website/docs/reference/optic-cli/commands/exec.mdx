Starts and Optic service locally to receive traffic from middleware integrated with your code, and starts your project. `exec` allows you to run any project in any environment and capture traffic. It takes the command to start your project as a required parameter.

:::tip api run
You can also take the command to start your project and define a task in `optic.yml` with only a `command` parameter. This task can be run with `api run <taskname>` and it will behave just like `api exec`. Please check out [an example](/reference/optic-yaml/tasks#what-are-some-examples-of-how-id-define-my-tasks)
:::

### Flags & Options

Exec has a few flags that can modify the default behavior:

- `-c`/`--print-coverage` prints how much of the documented API is covered by traffic seen in the capture session. The coverage prints once the session is terminated (`ctrl+c` or when tests finish running).
- `--ci` Enables CI-specific behavior. This enables `--print-coverage`, `--exit-on-diff`, and `pass-exit-code`.
- `--exit-on-diff` returns an exit code of `1` if unexpected API behavior is returned, such as an undocumented route or a change in behavior on a documented route. Normally, Optic returns `0` on successful termination regardless of the behavior observed. This is primarily used in CI/CD scenarios, such as in [GitHub Actions](/docs/github-actions), to fail builds when undocumented behavior is detected.
- `--pass-exit-code` returns the exit code of your task. If you are using a [dependent task](/docs/get-started/testing), the exit code of the dependent command (not the base command) will be passed through. This flag is overridden by - - - `--verbose` which provides extra troubleshooting information at task startup, task end, and when traffic is observed. We recommend using this when configuring a new task.

### Examples

To run your `start` task:

``` bash
api run start
```

``` bash
> api run baseline-ignores --collect-diffs
[optic] Running dependent task start...
[optic] Review the API Diff at http://localhost:34444/apis/2/diffs
[optic] Optic is observing requests made to http://localhost:3001
...
[optic] Observed Unexpected API Behavior. Run "api status"
```

### Special notes

The `run` tasks start a proxy, and will set the host headers to the targetUrl if provided. If not (such as when only a `command` and `inboundUrl` are given) the inboundUrl, which should be localhost, will be used in the request host header.
