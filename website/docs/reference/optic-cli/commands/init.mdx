Integrates Optic with your API. API init [guides you through setup](/docs/) so that you can get running as quickly as possible. There are no required parameters, and the CLI will take you directly to the Optic dashboard to complete and test the integration.

### Flags & Options

The following optional parameters may be included to pre-populate configuration parameters:

- `inboundUrl`
- `targetUrl`
- `command`

### Examples

#### Initialize a project

To initialize Optic with your project use:

``` bash
api init
```

``` bash
<your present working directory>
Is this your API's root directory? (yes/no): yes
What is this API named?: <api name>
[optic] Added Optic configuration to <your present working directory>/optic.yml
```

#### Initialize a project with task parameters

To initialize Optic with your project, passing a start command for your API project and setting the port on which Optic will listen for traffic to 4000 use:

``` bash
api init --command "./run" --inboundUrl https://localhost:4000 
```

which results in the same output as above, with the `start` taks in your `optic.yml` file pre-populated with the passed values.

#### Errors

When running api init against a project that has already been initialized, you'll see an error message:

``` bash
This directory already has an optic.yml file.
 You can see the current documentation for this project with api spec.
```
