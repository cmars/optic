Verifies that Optic can run your tasks and monitor traffic. When initializing Optic with your repository, the guided setup will have you run this command to validate the configuration. If there are any issues, they will be reported on the command line and in the Optic setup UI with recommendations on how to proceed. It takes the name of the task you wish to check, usually `start`:

### Flags & Options

This command takes no flags and has no options.

### Examples

#### Check a task configuration

To check your `start` task configuration use:

``` bash
api check start
```

``` bash
[optic] Checking task start

Your command: node server.js --watch db.json --routes routes.json --port $PORT
  ✔ Starts a long running process (your API)
  ✔ On the host Optic assigns it $HOST (current: localhost)
  ✔ On the port Optic assigns it $PORT (current: 3463)


Given this inboundUrl: http://localhost:3001
  ✔ Optic proxy is able to start its proxy here localhost:3001

[optic] All Passed! This task is setup properly. Nice work!
[optic] To start this task, run: api start
```

#### Errors

If api check runs into issues validating your task, it will report them:

``` bash
[optic] Checking task start


Your command: echo "Setup A Valid Command to Start your API!"
  ✖ Starts a long running process (your API)
    → Your command exited early
    On the host Optic assigns it $HOST (current: localhost)
    On the port Optic assigns it $PORT (current: 3472)


Given this inboundUrl: http://localhost:4000
  ✖ Optic proxy is able to start its proxy here localhost:4000
    → Optic could not start here: localhost:4000
