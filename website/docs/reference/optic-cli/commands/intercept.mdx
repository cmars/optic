Runs traffic against an `environment` definition from your `optic.yml` file. It is intended to be a low-friction way to observe traffic to a target, and has minimal options and configurations available. `api intercept` takes the name of the environment you wish to browse in, such as `production`, and the browser you want to use as a flag, such as `--chrome`. You may have multiple [environment definitions](/reference/optic-yaml/environments) depending on your project. 

### Flags & Options

Intercept takes the name of the environment, as defined in `optic.yml`, and a flag for the desired browser. Currently suported flags:

- `--chrome`

### Examples

To intercept traffic to GitHub's API:

```sh
api intercept production --chrome
```

```yml title='optic.yml'
environments:
  production:
    host: https://api.github.com
    webUI: https://api.github.com/repos/opticdev/optic
```

```sh title='Output'
