Exports an OpenAPI 3.0.1 specification. This allows you to generate an OpenAPI specification for use in other software, such as third-party documentation generation software. Both `--json` and `--yaml` flags are supported to determine the output format. By default, a `.yaml` file is created.

:::tip api scripts
The scripts command will export an OpenAPI specification and allow you to run a command or script to process that specification. It can even manage dependencies! `generate:oas` is great for a one-time run, for workflow integration we recommend [scripts](/reference/optic-cli/commands/generate).
:::

### Flags & Options

There are two optional flags that determine which formats will be exported. You may use both flags if you need both formats:

- `--json`
- `--yaml`
