Runs a task from your `optic.yml` file. This is the command you will use to start a task, such as for observing traffic or running tests. It takes the name of the task you wish to run, usually `start`. You may have multiple, advanced [task configurations](/reference/optic-yaml/tasks) depending on your project. 

`api run start`

:::tip api start
Since start is the most common task run, Optic has a command `start` that is an alias for `run start`.
:::

### Flags & Options

Run has a few flags that can modify the default behavior:

- `-c`/`--print-coverage` prints how much of the documented API is covered by traffic seen in the capture session. The coverage prints once the session is terminated (`ctrl+c` or when tests finish running).
- `--ci` Enables CI-specific behavior. This enables `--print-coverage`, `--exit-on-diff`, and `pass-exit-code`.
- `--exit-on-diff` returns an exit code of `1` if unexpected API behavior is returned, such as an undocumented route or a change in behavior on a documented route. Normally, Optic returns `0` on successful termination regardless of the behavior observed. This is primarily used in CI/CD scenarios, such as in [GitHub Actions](/docs/github-actions), to fail builds when undocumented behavior is detected.
- `--pass-exit-code` returns the exit code of your task. If you are using a [dependent task](/docs/get-started/testing), the exit code of the dependent command (not the base command) will be passed through. This flag is overridden by `--exit-on-diff` which will always exit a capture session with exit code 1 when a diff was detected. 

### Examples

To run your `start` task:

```bash
api run start
```

which results in:
```bash
> api run baseline-ignores --collect-diffs
[optic] Running dependent task start...
[optic] Review the API Diff at http://localhost:34444/apis/2/diffs
[optic] Optic is observing requests made to http://localhost:3001
...
[optic] Observed Unexpected API Behavior. Run "api status"
```
