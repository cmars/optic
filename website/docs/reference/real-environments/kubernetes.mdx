Optic currently offers only rudimentary integration with Kubernetes. The particulars depend on your service-mesh or load-balancing architecture.

In cases where [Envoy](envoy-proxy) or [NGINX](nginx) is used, you can use those Optic integrations instead.

Integrations with cloud provider ingress load balancers, and Istio and other service meshes are coming soon!
