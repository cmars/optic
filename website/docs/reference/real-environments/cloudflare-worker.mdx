1. We'll provide you with the latest copy of our beta Optic Cloudflare Worker integration and instructions to complete the setup.

1. Make sure that you define the Optic configuration variables:

    ```jsx
    INSTALL_OPTIONS = {
     
        "opticToken": "Your Optic Token",

        "opticSourceID": "A unique identifier for this source of data",

        "opticSourceTags": "A comma separated list of other labels to send to Optic"
    };
    INSTALL_TYPE = 'custom';
    ```

1. Set up a worker route matching the requests you want Optic to see.
