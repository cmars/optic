tasks!!


[In Optic, a `task` is a way to manually configure traffic capture for your project, often against a local target. It is very flexible in that it can take a `command` to start your project, and `inboundURL` and `targetURL` to define the downstream and upstream proxy URLs. You won't need to use all of these parameters: which ones you choose will depend on how you want to capture your traffic. If you want to point Optic at a remote host with no other configuration, consider [environments](#what-are-environments) instead.]
