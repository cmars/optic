title: The Ignore File
---

As you use Optic, you will probably find there are some paths you would like Optic to ignore. These can be identified individually in the undocumented endpoint review page in the UI. For ignoring routes in bulk by some characteristic, you can directly edit the project's ignore rules. Examples include ignoring all `OPTIONS` requests, `.html`, `.js`, `.css` files, or everything in your `/public` folder. Many of these are provided by default, and can be removed if necessary.

You can add ignore rules to your `.optic/ignore` file:

``` txt
# Default Ignore Rules
# Learn to configure your own at http://localhost:4000/reference/optic-yaml/ignore
OPTIONS (.*)
HEAD (.*)
GET (.*).htm
GET (.*).html
GET (.*).css
GET (.*).js
...
```

Rules follow the following format: 

``` txt
METHOD(s) path
```

1. The methods component can be:
    - a single method `GET`
    - multiple methods `GET POST PUT`
    - omitted -> which is interpreted as `ALL`
1. The path component follows the [path-to-regex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path-to-regexp) format. The library has a lot of advanced features that you can use, but most use cases can probably be accomplished with the following patterns:
    - Want to ignore an absolute path? Just write it ie `/users/profile`
    - Want to ignore a file type? ie `(.*).png`  `(.*).js`
    - Want to ignore a path and its children? `/public/(.*)`
    - Need something more advanced? Try creating your pattern in the [path-to-regex-sandbox](http://forbeslindesay.github.io/express-route-tester/)
1. Scalar values in YAML cannot start with a special character (`` [] {} > | * & ! % # ` @ , ``). If you need to start a value with `*`, wrap the value in double quotes.

### Examples

``` txt
OPTIONS (.*)               # Ignores all Options requests
/public/(.*)               # Ignores all Requests to public/**
GET (.*).js                # Ignores all GET requests to a resource ending in .js
GET POST PUT /resource     #Ignores all GET, POST, PUT requests to /resource
```
