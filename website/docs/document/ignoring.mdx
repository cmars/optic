> Keep the signal/noise ratio reasonable by ignoring certain paths on your hostname ie the routes that serve HTML, images, js, etc.

**Outcome**: Learn how to add ignore rules right from within Optic


You should be on Document New Endpoints page with a few URLs captured for resources you do not want in the API documentation:

<Paper elevation={3}>

SOMETHING WITH TRAFFIC YOU WOULD WANT TO IGNORE

</Paper>

*Not seeing any URLs to document?* [Capture more traffic and come back to this step](/document)

## Adding Ignore Rules from the Optic UI

- Show the basic case ignoring a URL 1:1 (from the dropdown)

- Show the medium-advanced case, ignoring a pattern of URLs

- These rules are saved to .optic/api/ignore, if you check them in, your team will get the same ignore rules.

VALUE: Noise reduced, get back to documenting

## Advanced Usage

- You can edit this file .optic/api/ignore manually to add / remove or update patterns.
- The basic format for a rule line is ``

- Link them to the advanced usage Guide

<PreviewPageModalFakeLink
  link={'/reference/optic-yaml/ignore'}
  title={`Advanced Usage of Ignore Rules`}
  linkText={`Advanced Usage of Ignore Rules`}
  source={<Ignore />}
/>


VALUE: when you need to do something advanced with ignore rules  you can. Keep signal noise right for you and your team
