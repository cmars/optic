Do you see any paths that shouldn't be there? Optic comes with a set of default ignore rules that handle most of the common non-API traffic an API server might handle. You may find there are certain paths or patterns you want to ignore that aren't in the default list. Ignore rules can be added in the UI. For example, we have some test traffic to the `GET /api/notyetimplemented` endpoint in this capture. This route won't be implemented for a while, if ever, and we want to ignore requests to it. At the bottom of the unmatched URL learning page, we can build ignore rules dynamically.

The Ignore Rule generator will automatically suggest routes that match the pattern as you type. Here, we've suggested "not", and the generator suggested an ignore rule for the `GET /api/notyetimplemented` route. After selecting the suggestion, a complete ignore rule is built and ready to be accepted. There's also a link to our more in-depth [ignore rules and pattern matching](TODO) when you hover over the information button.

Once complete, we've removed extraneous routes and can focus on only those paths that lead to API endpoints:

The next step is to learn all of these endpoints in one pass, instead of one at a time. Let's finish up documenting our API from this traffic.
