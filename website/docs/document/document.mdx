### Use Real Traffic to Document your API
It does not matter if your API is years old or brand new -- wherever you are, Optic makes it easy to get any API documented, and keep those docs up-to-date. It's like having Git, but for your APIs.

Want to start versioning some of your existing API endpoints with Optic?

1. Collect API traffic
2. Add them to the spec in just a few clicks


*Try out the UI without downloading Optic:*
<IFrameDemoNotCentered demoPath={'/demos/github/review'} />

</DemoPageModal>

## Capture Traffic
Optic captures real API traffic, and uses its observations to document the behavior of your API. When you're first on-boarding your API to Optic, we recommend using a mix of **Manual Traffic Collection** techniques and **Automated Traffic Collection** techniques. If you have good test coverage, or some other automated traffic sources (like Postman) already set up, you can use those to get the core of your API documented very quickly. Anything you don't have good tests for can be captured by making requests to your API manually or intercepting traffic from your Browsers to your running application (applicable to webapps).

<Tabs
  defaultValue="manual"

    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
    {label: 'Automated', value: 'automated'},
    {label: 'Passive (Live Environments)', value: 'passive'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="manual">

**Capture Traffic by using your API / App**:

Setup an `api start` command for your framework. Requests to the API when its run with Optic's CLI will be captured

<ShowAllFrameworks/>

Intercept traffic from your browser's network tab. Just run `api intercept` and API calls you see in the Network Tab will be captured by Optic.

<ShowAllBrowsers />
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="automated">

**Capture Traffic by running your API tests**

Setup an `api test` command for your framework:
<ShowAllFrameworks/>

Capture Traffic from your other API Tools:
<ShowAllTools />

</TabItem>

## Document the API

Let's check if we've captured enough traffic to start documenting our API.

- Run `api status`
  - If you see API paths, run `api status --review` top open the Optic UI
  - If you have not been able to capture any traffic
    - go back to the previous step
    - get help from the maintainers by clicking here [INTERCOM LINK ASAP]

```bash
$ api status

Computing API diffs... Done!
‚úì  No diffs observed for existing endpoints
   Undocumented URLs observed
      (use "api status --review" to start documenting them
          GET   /todos
        PATCH   /todos/mc6ttk3vv
         POST   /todos/
```
