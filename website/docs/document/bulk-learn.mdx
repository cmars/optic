title: Learn Several Endpoints at Once
slug: /document/advanced/bulk
---
> Once you get the hang of using Optic, you can speed up your baselining by documenting dozens of endpoints at once

**Outcome**: A fast workflow to document the remaining endpoints in your API quickly

You should have a few URLs on the Document New Endpoints page that have path parameters ie `GET /todos/:todoId/status`:

## Using Bulk Mode to Learn Multiple Endpoints

- Explain the Toggle
- EXPLAIN WHAT you are doing -- Call back w/ links to the previous documentation about parameterizing
- "Behind the scenes This works just like adding an endpoint one at a time"
- Show that the endpoints they document show up in "Recently Added"

VALUE: You'll finish documenting your API much faster with this feature

## Naming in Bulk

- Show how that they can go name the endpoints from the root page, or by clicking inside
- discard works too if they made a mistake

VALUE: and you can document faster too to explain your API to your team and consumers.

## Are there some URLs in the list that are not part of the API?
answer one question

Optic captures everything....unless you ignore it....
