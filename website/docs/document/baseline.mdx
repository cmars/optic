Now that [Optic works with your API](/document), it's time to start documenting your observed traffic. As an example, we've captured traffic to 8 paths in a sample Todo API:

</Paper>

## Ignoring endpoints

Optic comes with a set of default ignore rules that capture most of the common non-API traffic an API server might handle. You may find there are certain paths or patterns you want to ignore that aren't in the default list. Ignore rules can be added in the UI. For example, we have some test traffic to the `GET /api/notyetimplemented` endpoint in this capture. This route won't be implemented for a while, and we want to ignore requests to it until it is ready.

</Paper>

The Ignore Rule generator at the lower left will automatically suggest routes that match the pattern you type. Here, we've suggested "not", and a rule was suggested to ignore the `GET /api/notyetimplemented` route. After selecting the suggestion, a complete ignore rule is built and ready to be accepted. There's also a link to our more in-depth [ignore rules and pattern matching](TODO)

Once complete, we've removed extraneous routes and can focus on only those paths that lead to API endpoints:

## Parameterizing endpoint paths

There are 7 unmatched URLs left for us to automatically learn in this example. However, sometimes multiple unmatched URLs all go to a single endpoint. For example, the three calls to `GET /api/user/` here differ only in an integer value, the ID of the user:

<Paper elevation={3}>

![3 user paths that map to one endpoint](/img/docs/doc-example-param-path.png)

</Paper>

The User ID is an example of a **path parameter**. We can identify any element of a path as a path parameter, and any pahs that match the pattern will be consolidaed into a single endpoint. For example, we can click on the `3` above and identify this as a `UserId`. The other two paths (ending in `1` and `2`) will automatically be recognized as part of the same endpoint, and all three traffic samples will be used to generate the documentation for the endpoint. This also reduces the number of endpoints to learn.

</Paper>

Once you've ignored any extraneous traffic and consolidated any parameterized paths, you can click through each endpoint to review it and add it to the documentation individually. When starting out, we recommend using the **bulk mode** by enabling the toggle. This allows you to check multiple endpoints, or check to select all endpoints, and learn their behaviors in bulk. This is a great way to establish the behavior of an API as it is observed today, so you acn move on quickly to detecting changes in expected behavior.
