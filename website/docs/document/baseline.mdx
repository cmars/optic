> Documenting the endpoints in your API takes seconds with Optic. Just click "+" and name the endpoint.

**Outcome**: Add the first endpoints to your Optic specification

**Do this ⤵️**

If we run `api status -- review`, the Optic UI will open, and we should see some undocumented URLs:
- Click on the Undocumented URLs Row above to start learning from the URLs Optic observed
- *Not seeing any URLs to document?* [Capture more traffic and come back to this step](/document)

## Documenting your first endpoint

[LOU NOTES]
- Explain the page they're seeing. Get a new picture where one of the endpoints is already documented, and one is recently added, so you can do it justice

On the left you'll see all the URLs Optic observed that do not match any of the endpoints in our specification. On the right side of the page are all the endpoints that are already in your specification. You can see the new ones we add, show up with a green background, indicating that we've just added them:

**Do this ⤵️**

- To keep it simple, choose an endpoint without any path parameters ie  `GET /todos` *(we'll learn how to document endpoints with path parameters next)*.
- Click the **"+"** icon in the row:

Optic used everything it learned watching traffic to document this endpoint for us. You could look at the same information and manually write the spec file yourself, but Optic has made it much easier by doing that work for you.

**Do this ⤵️**

- Name the endpoint: Here, the `Gets all todos` description was added.
- Click through **Add Endpoint** to add it to the specification

Optic has staged the `GET /api/todos` endpoint for commit. That is, Optic has learned about this endpoint from the traffic it observed, and is ready to save what it learned to the spec. Learning an endpoint is like staging changes in Git. It is not until you click **Save Changes** that you commit those changes to the spec.

You can safely stage as many endpoints as you like before committing them to your documentation.

**Do this ⤵️**

- For now, let's save this endpoint and give it a commit message:

## What happens when Optic sees a different shape?
Optic learns your API's behavior incrementally. If you missed an endpoint in this capture or if the example Optic learned originally did not include every possible response code, field or other variations, that's ok. Optic will suggest those additions to your API specifications as it observes more traffic.

When you make changes to your API, Optic can help you document those too. You can learn more about how Optic helps you change your API here.

## What about Path Parameters?
Most API endpoints are parameterized, ie `GET /todos/:todoId/status`. Optic makes it easy to document parameterized endpoints as well, let's try that next!
