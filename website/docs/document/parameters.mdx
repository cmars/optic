## Document an endpoint with a path parameter

- show the user how to do one

VALUE: Now you have documented an endpoint with path parameters!

## Document related endpoints with the same path parameters

- show the magic of the re-using the names from before

VALUE: look how fast that was

## Did you make a mistake?
teach one thing

Once you start adding path parameters things can get complicated...if you forget to set one, or want to redo....heck ya
- Great opportunity to show them how to rename path parameters before committing
- Discard / Delete entire endpoints


## Is it possible to automatically learn all the endpoints?
answer one question

tease the bulk mode...BULK MODE NEXT
