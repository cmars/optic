<>Optic is easy to integrate with {frontMatter.title} using the <a href={frontMatter.sdk_url}>Optic SDK</a>, and you won't have to change your development flow to start documenting your traffic with Optic. For example, let's say you usually develop against your {frontMatter.title} project locally and view the application on localhost:3005. </>


## Integrating Optic with your API project

### Optic needs to know how to start your API

The `optic.yml` file tells Optic how to start up your application. This allows Optic to pass it the appropriate environment variables for the SDK to properly integrate with the Optic CLI.

```
name: Foo API
tasks:
  start:
    command: ./foo --bar
```

### Your project needs to send Optic traffic via Middleware

<>Optic will start your application with some environment variables. The Optic SDK provides a middleware to send your API traffic to an Optic service (in this case, the local service you set up above). The <a href={frontMatter.sdk_readme}>readme for this SDK</a> will walk you through the few lines needed to import and activate the middleware.</>

## Verifying with `api check start`

Once your application has integrated the Optic SDK and the middleware is ready to send data to Optic, you should be ready to check your setup:

`api check start`

will start up your application with the necessary environment variables. It expects the process to be a "long-running" process, in that it should start the API project and be active while the API project is up. If Optic has any problems running your application, it will report them on the terminal. Please [let us know](https://github.com/opticdev/optic/issues/new?title=%5Bsetup%5D:%20Error%20running%20check) and we'll be happy to help out. You can also schedule a [quick chat with the maintainers](https://calendly.com/opticlabs/maintainer-office-hours).

## Run your API through Optic

Once the check passes, everything should be set up to capture your traffic and start documenting your API. We recommend testing this process to get familiar with the flow. First, start your API project with Optic:

`api start`

Since this project uses the Optic SDK, you can begin interacting with your API normally. Use whatever method you would normally use during development to test out your application, such as navigating the project through a web browser or using a test tool such as Postman. You should send at least five requests to your application. As you send requests, The Optic CLI should report the last request seen and its response code on the terminal.

Once you have at least five captures, press `ctrl+c` on the terminal to end your Optic session. Optic will launch the [Optic dashboard](http://localhost:34444/apis/1/diffs) to show you the captured traffic. Since there is no documentation yet, you should see the traffic marked as unmatched URLs. You're ready to document your API!

If you run into problems here, we definitely want to know about them.
