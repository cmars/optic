<>Optic is easy to integrate with {frontMatter.title} using the <a href={frontMatter.sdk_url}>Optic SDK</a>, and you won't have to change your development flow to start documenting your traffic with Optic. For example, let's say you usually develop against your {frontMatter.title} project locally and view the application on localhost:3005. </>


## Integrating Optic with your API project

### Optic needs to know how to start your API

The `optic.yml` file tells Optic how to start up your application. This allows Optic to pass it the appropriate environment variables for the SDK to properly integrate with the Optic CLI.

```
name: Foo API
tasks:
  start:
    command: ./foo --bar
```

### Your project needs to send Optic traffic via Middleware

<>Optic will start your application with some environment variables. The Optic SDK provides a middleware to send your API traffic to an Optic service (in this case, the local service you set up above). The <a href={frontMatter.sdk_readme}>readme for this SDK</a> will walk you through the few lines needed to import and activate the middleware.</>

## Verify your API is integrated with Optic

Once the check passes, everything should be set up to capture your traffic and start documenting your API. We recommend testing this process to get familiar with the flow. First, start your API project with Optic:

`api start --verbose`

Optic will report some basic information about startup so you can verify that is is running properly. Since your project uses the Optic SDK, you can begin interacting with your API normally as soon as Optic is running. Use whatever method you would normally use during development to test out your application, such as navigating the project through a web browser or using a test tool such as Postman. You should send at least five requests to your application. As you send requests, The Optic CLI should report the requests seen and their response codes on the terminal.

Once Optic has seen at least five interactions, press `ctrl+c` on the terminal to end your Optic session. Optic will summarize your session on the terminal and launch the [Optic dashboard](http://localhost:34444/apis/1/diffs) to show you the captured traffic. Since there is no documentation yet, you should see the traffic marked as unmatched URLs. You're ready to document your API!
