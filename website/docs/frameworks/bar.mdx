import { ShowWhenSdk, ShowWhenProxy } from '../../src/components/FrameworkHelper';

<ShowWhenSdk {...props}>

- Reusable component: What does SDK do?
  - logs traffic to Optic from middleware - "lets Optic look at your internal test traffic by using a middleware"
  - api start (this would be exec task but no need to complicate that here) replaces your command
  - code example: show `optic.yml` with a `start` and a `test` command, 

- SDK specific instructions - lean on READMEs where possible

- Reusable verbose component - same style as foo.mdx for SDK, but there's different check points for where we can see failures.

</ShowWhenSdk>

<ShowWhenProxy {...props}>
  When proxy mode
</ShowWhenProxy>
