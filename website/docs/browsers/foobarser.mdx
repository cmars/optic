<>Optic is easy to integrate with {frontMatter.title} using Optic's Intercept feature. Optic will start a local proxy and a browser session that's configured to use the local proxy for its browsing. When you visit the application site, Optic will capture that API traffic for you to document.</>


## Integrating Optic with your browsing session

### Optic needs to know where your API lives.

The `optic.yml` file tells Optic where to find your API. It is capable of configuring multiple environments, so no matter where you would like to document your API Optic can help. For example, you could have separate environment configurations for local, staging, and production. For now, let's assume we're going to document a production environment, to establish the baseline behavior as it exists today. We can for example document GitHub's API with:

```
name: Foo API
environments:
  production: 
    host: https://api.github.com
    webUI: https://api.github.com/repos/opticdev/optic
```

The `host` parameter defines the host for which all traffic will be assumed to be API traffic. Optic will capture any traffic sent to this host. The `webUI` parameter defines a default page for the new browser session. While it's optional, we recommend using your UI landing page to make documenting your API as smooth as possible.

## Run your API through Optic

<>Once your environment configuration is set, you're ready to browse your project through {frontMatter.title} and collect traffic to document with Optic. Optic will launch {frontMatter.title} with the necessary configurations to capture your API traffic by running:</>

`api intercept production --foobarser`

<>Make sure you use the new session of {frontMatter.title} that Optic launches to navigate your project. You should send at least five requests to your API while navigating your project to verify the capture is working properly. As you navigate your project, the Optic CLI will report the last request seen that was sent to the API host and the response status code.</>

Once you have at least five captures, press `ctrl+c` on the terminal to end your Optic session. Optic will launch the [Optic dashboard](http://localhost:34444/apis/1/diffs) to show you the captured traffic. Since there is no documentation yet, you should see the traffic marked as unmatched URLs. You're ready to document your API!
