> When your existing tests are run with Optic, you gain the ability to fail the test suite when the API contract is not met. Verify your API contract is met with the tests you already have.


- How do you know your API meets the contract in its specification?
- Would you API tests fail if you accidentally removed a field or otherwise changed the API contract?
- Do you know what parts of your API are actually being called by your tests? Is that coverage getting better?

### Running Tests with Optic

**When your existing tests are run with Optic, you gain the ability to fail the test suite when the API contract is not met.**

Optic is watching the test traffic and diffing it against the current API specification to make sure the API is working as intended whenever the tests pass.

Without any changes to your tests, you can start using what you already have to enforce the API contract, and catch any unplanned changes before a consumer does:

```
> api run test

<ExpandDocs title="How it works" defaultOpen={false}>

Contract testing your API is both difficult and essential. Teams who have tried this at scale quickly realize the test cases are tedious to maintain and require complex mocking. After all that effort, these tests often fail to detect important changes because it is too easy for a manually written contract tests to end up incomplete or out-of-date.

**Optic takes whatever automated test traffic you can produce, and turns it into a contract test suite for you.**

Imagine a test that POSTs a new todo. We could write assertions about the shape of the response body and all the fields that come back, but that would take a lot of time and be difficult to maintain. When we run the same test through Optic, the traffic from this one test is verified by checking dozens of additional assertions dynamically applied by Optic as the traffic is observed.

```
-- Manual Assertions --
200 Response

-- Additional Assertions from Optic --
Request Body must be application/json
with an object at the root
and a field called `task` that is a string
....and 10 more
Any 200 response for this endpoint must be application/json
with an object at the root
and a field called `task` that is a string
and a field called `created_at` which is string, with format a IS0 8601 date
...and 32 more

## API Coverage and API Diffs

Optic builds two reports when your test runs:

1. **API Coverage report** -- Think of this like code coverage, but for APIs. The coverage report records which endpoints, request parameters and response status codes are observed by Optic. When you have API coverage, it means that most of your API is covered by these test suites.

2. **API Diff report** -- Optic will record all the API diffs it observed while your tests run. New fields, undocumented responses, removed or changed fields -- it's all recorded by Optic.


When teams run their tests with Optic, they often use the `--exit-on-diff` flag to cause their tests to `exit 1` if either the test suite fails or diffs are detected.

```
> api run test --exit-on-diff
```

| Scenario                                                   | Tests | Diffs   | Coverage Report | Result |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Tests pass, with no diffs, and traffic for 10/10 endpoints | ✅     | ✅       | 100%            | Passed |
| Tests pass, with 2 diffs, and traffic for 2/10 endpoints   | ✅     | 2 diffs | 20%             | Failed |
| Tests fail, with 0 diffs, and traffic for 10/10 endpoints  | ⚠️     | ✅       | 100%            | Failed |
| Tests fail, with 5 diffs, and traffic for 7/10 endpoints   | ⚠️     | 5 diffs | 70%             | Failed |
