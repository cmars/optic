title: Run tests with Optic
slug: /test/with-optic

> When your existing tests are run through Optic, you gain the ability to fail the test suite when the API contract is not met.

import { ShowAllFrameworks } from '../../src/components/ShowAllFrameworks';
import { ShowAllTools } from '../../src/components/ShowAllTools';

## Collect traffic from your Automated Tests with Optic

Setup an `api test` command for your framework:

<ShowAllFrameworks/>

Capture Traffic from your other API Tools:
<ShowAllTools />


## Naming your test tasks
Optic recommends keeping things simple and calling your test task `test`, so you can run it with `api run test` or `api test`. However, if you have multiple test commands, you can call them whatever makes sense to your team. For this guide we'll stick to `api run test` to keep it simple, but you can sub this for any other task in the `optic.yml`

## Running your tests tasks
```
api run test
```

### API Coverage
- how to print it
- what it means

show an example with less than 100% coverage

show an example with more than 100%

### Exit on Diff
- why should users want to exit on diffs?
- it lets them fail the tests, when the API behavior has changed.

### Want to run Optic in CI?
- why: It's a simple way to make sure there that no unplanned API changes get introduced
