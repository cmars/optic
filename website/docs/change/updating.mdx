title: Updating your Specification
slug: /change/updating

> We built Optic to make it easier for developers to maintain accurate, and up-to-date specifications for their APIs without writing OpenAPI by hand.

When your API changes, your specification needs to change with it. Optic allows you to update your specification easily, by observing your new tests to verify its behavior or by manually making changes to define your target behavior.

### Detecting API Changes and updating your Specification


**Resources**
- [Using `api status` command](/change/api-status)
- [Reviewing Diffs to Existing Endpoints](/change/diff-review)

### Manually Editing the Specification

**Resources**
- [Deleting Endpoints](/change/endpoint/delete)
- [Reverting Optic Commits](/change/revert-commit)
- [Editing Descriptions](/change/descriptions/edit)
- [Adding Endpoints](/change/endpoint/add)
- [Editing the Shape of API Bodies](/change/bodies/edit)
