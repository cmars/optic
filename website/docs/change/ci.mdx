> Add Optic to Git Workflow + CI to help your team design great APIs, talk about API change, and prevent unplanned breaks.

When you're working with a team to build and evolve an API, you want to make sure you don't introduce unexpected change that haven't been reviewed and make cause issues. Optic makes this possible by watching the traffic to and from your API in your build pipeline and comparing it against your existing spec. If there are any changes, Optic will point them out and allow you to fail your build process so the changes don't make it to production.

The biggest benefit is that this can all happen automatically. It doesn't require someone to manually check a spec and compare it against what's already deployed. Optic can do that work for you so you can safely move quickly.
